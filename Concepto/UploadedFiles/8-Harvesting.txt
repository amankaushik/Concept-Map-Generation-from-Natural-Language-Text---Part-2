Harvesting of a crop is an important task. The cutting of crop after 
it is mature is called harvesting. In harvesting, crops are pulled 
out or cut close to the ground. It usually takes 3 to 4 months for a 
cereal crop to mature. Harvesting in our country is either done 
manually by sickle (Fig. 1.7) or by a machine called harvester. In 
the harvested crop, the grain Fig. 1.7 : seeds need to be separated 
from the chaff. This process is called threshing. This is carried 
out with the help of a machine called ‘combine’ which is in fact a 
combined harvester and thresher (Fig. 1.8). Farmers with small 
holdings of land do the separation of grain and chaff by winnowing.
